This is a fork from the [Andino Project](https://github.com/Ekumen-OS/andino/tree/humble) from Ekumen-OS.
This fork was made with the porpouse of adapting the project to be run with 3D printed encoder disks and a 
Raspberry Pi 5 for the [Engineering College of National University of La Plata](https://ing.unlp.edu.ar/) 
who implemented this project with students of Robotics Introduction class. All the changes can be followed
in the guides section [Guias](https://github.com/Petrigh/andino/tree/humble/docs/guides)
